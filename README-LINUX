Getting Started with GridLAB-D

Building GridLAB-D with the Auto-Toolset Under Linux and Other Unix Variants
You must have autoconf, automake, libtool, xerces-c and cppunit install to
build GridLAB-D in this way.

If you are building from a release distribution you must first run:

      % cd <source-path>
      % ./configure
      % make 

Build GridLAB-D from the makefiles provided in the distribution, which will
create targets in the same directory as the input source.  Libraries are
created using libtool which outputs libraries in a directory named '.libs' in
the input's source directory.  Use 'make install' to install GridLAB-D on the
system.  You must be superuser (or use sudo) to install to the system. If you
want to install GridLAB-D to a different location, use:

      % make install prefix=<install-path>.  

where <install-path> is the full path to the installation directory.

Whenever changes have been made to configure.ac or any of the makefile.am
files, the following build steps must be executed from the source-path folder:  
	1. Use 'autoreconf -isf' to update the configure script.
	2. Use './configure' to create the makefiles.
	3. Repeat the above command to make the project as usual.

Make should detect changes to configure.ac and makefile.am files and
automatically rerun steps 1 and 2 as needed.  If files are added to a module,
add the filename to makefile.am in that module's directory and remake. If make
does not automatically perform the required steps, rerun autoreconf -isf and
./configure manually.

To distribute the source code, it is best to check out a clean copy of the
source code and then package the resulting source tree using the
utilities/release-src command from the <source-path> directory.

On Apple OS-X, the GNU libtools are prefixed with a 'g' to differentiate them
from the NeXTStep libtool.  Before performing the steps above, tell the
autotoolset where to find libtool and libtoolize by setting the LIBTOOL and
LIBTOOLIZE environment variables.  The following lines are an example:

    % export LIBTOOL=/usr/bin/glibtool
    % export LIBTOOLIZE=/usr/bin/glibtoolize
    % autoreconf -isf
 
For information on the sample models, see samples/README.

On HP Superdome you may run into a problem with rpl_malloc being undefined
during the build.  If so, set the following environment before running
./configure

    % export ac_cv_func_malloc_0_nonnull=yes
