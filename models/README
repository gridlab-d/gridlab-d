GridLAB-D installs with three gridlab model sample files:

residential_loads.glm
powerflow_IEEE_4node.glm
powerflow_IEEE_37node.glm

To run GridLAB-D, change to the models folder and specify a model file as input

   % gridlabd.exe residential_loads
   
Other command-line options can be used to provide information about the model run. For examples, the following command-line outputs the model in an xml format after the run:

   % gridlabd.exe residential_loads -o <filename.xml>
   
To list additional command-line options, use:

   % gridlabd.exe -h

The residential_loads model will produce outputs files with .csv extensions.
The powerflow_IEEE_*node models do not produce any output files unless requested using additional command-line optinos.  See the comments in the files for details on what they do.

If the current directory is not set to the location of the model file, a full
path to the model file can be given on the command line. However, some models
include additional input files specified using only relative paths. These
models may require editing to provide a full path. All models shipped with
GridLAB-D are set up to run correctly from the models current directory.
