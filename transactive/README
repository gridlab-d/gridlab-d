The transactive module was designed and built by David Chassin (UVic-ME/PNNL) 
and Sahand Behboodi Kalhori (UVic-ME).

Linking MATLAB
--------------

The transactive module requires MATLAB to build.  You must set the environment 
variable MATLAB to the path for your most recent install of MATLAB.  This is
required before you can build the transactive module. If you have not set the
variable correctly you will set an error like

linalg.cpp(15) : fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'matrix.h': No 
such file or directory

To set the environment variable on your system, open the [Start Menu] and 
right-click on [Computer]. Select [Properties] and click on [Advanced 
Settings]. You should see the "System Properties" dialog.  Select [Environment
Variables] to bring up the dialog to edit environment variables.

Click [New] and enter the following:

Variable name:  [MATLAB                              ]
Variable value: [C:\Program Files\MATLAB\<version>   ]

where <version> is the most recent version of Matlab you have installed.  If
your path is different, you must adjust the value accordingly. The folder you
enter must at least contain the standard Matlab "extern" folder for GridLAB-D
to build correctly.

When you are done click [Ok] as needed to close and save your changes.  You 
must log out and log in again for this change to take effect.

Running with MATLAB
-------------------

If you get an error such as "missing libeng.lib" when you run GridLAB-D using
the transactive module, this means that your PATH environment does not include
the MATLAB library folder.  Using the method for linking MATLAB described
above, you must add your MATLAB platform library folder to your system's PATH 
environment. When in the [Environment Variables] dialog select PATH and click 
[Edit]:

Variable name: PATH
Variable value: [<existing path>;C:\Program Files\MATLAB\<version>\bin\<platform>]

where <existing path> is the path already defined (don't alter it), <version>
is the most recent version of MATLAB installed on your system, and <platform>
is either "win32" or "win64" depending on which platform you are building in
Visual Studio.
