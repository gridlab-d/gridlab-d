//Microwave Energy Simulation

//this program tests to see whether the energy is calculated correctly for a given installed power, standby power, and demand
//there are 3 variables used in the microwave module to calculate energy use:
//installed_power - the real power draw when the microwave is on
//standby_power - the real power draw when the microwave is off
//demand - the fraction of the time interval specified that microwave is on
//the module has a default power factor of 0.95

//so the energy is calulated by using the equation below

// E = [(Poff)*(1-D)+(Pon)*(D)]*(dt)
//     ----------------------------- @ inverse cos(.95)
//	            pf
// where:
//E (kWh)   = the energy consumed by the microwave
//Poff (kW) = the standby power of the microwave
//D (unit)  = fraction of the  time interval specified ranging from (0-1)
//Pon (kW)  = installed power of the microwave
//dt (hrs)  = the time interval specified for the demand
//pf (unit) = the power factor of the microwave

//Please note that the accuracy of this model is only valid for a constant power draw from the microwave.
//If the demand is greater than zero or less than 1 then the accuracy will go condiderably.
//This is because the module doesn't start the cycling process for a number of time steps.
//This test is only to verify that the microwave module is caclulating the correct amount of energy thereby
//confirming the correct power usage.
