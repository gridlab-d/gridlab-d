//Microwave internal gain test
//test_microwave_internal_gains.glm
//The program checks to see that the correct internal gain is displayed when the microwave is on
//and when the microwave is on standby.
//if the microwave is off then the internal gain = magnitude of standby power.
//if the microwave is on then the internal gain = magnitude of installed power * heat fraction
