	The ZIPload simulation is based on demand profile of the connected ZIPload loads.
	Individual power fractions and power factors are used.
	Heat fraction ratio is used to calculate the internal gain from ZIPload loads.

	The demand response model is based from a paper written by David Chassin and Jason Fuller
	"On the Equilibrium Dynamics of Demand Response in Thermostatic Loads" accepted by HICSS
	 - This model is very much in the preliminary stage and only looks at the equilibrium solutions
	   of a population of devices as a function of customer demand and thermostatic duty cycles
