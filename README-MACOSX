Getting Started with GridLAB-D

Building GridLAB-D with the Auto-Toolset Under Linux and Other Unix Variants
You must have autoconf, automake, libtool, and xerces-c installed to build 
GridLAB-D in this way. With newer versions of the mac os, you will also need 
gnu sed and have it symlinked to sed.  To install the necessary tools, we 
recommend using XCode and homebrew.

Install XCode

In the XCode menu, select Preferences.  Select the Downloads tab.  Select 
Command Line Tools and install.

Install homebrew
      % sudo ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)"
      % sudo brew doctor

Install autoconf, automake, and libtool
      % sudo brew install autoconf
      % sudo brew install automake
      % sudo brew install libtool

The above commands should create symlinks in /usr/local/bin to each of these
tools.  On some combinations of XCode version and Mac OSX version, the
symlinks don't get created.  If this is the case, create them with
      % sudo brew ln --force autoconf
      % sudo brew ln --force automake
      % sudo brew ln --force libtool

Install gnu sed
      % sudo brew install gnu-sed

Symlink gsed to sed
      % sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/gsed /usr/local/bin/sed

Make sure symlinked sed is the first instance of sed in the path
      % which sed

If /usr/local/bin/sed is not the response, put /usr/local/bin first in the path
      % export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH

If you are building from a source distribution you must first run:

      % cd gridlab-d/trunk
      % autoreconf -isf

You will most likely need to build and install XercesC:

      % cd third_party
      % . install_xercesc

If you are using the powerflow module, you will need to build SuperLU:

      % cd third_party
      % gunzip SuperLU*.gz
      % tar xvf SuperLU*.tar
      % cd SuperLU_3.1

and follow the build instructions in the README file.  Note that you will
have to set the path to the library in make.inc by hand. 	

You may get an error at the end regarding ldconfig--ignore it.  Then you
may configure and build

      % cd ..
      % ./configure
      % make 

Build GridLAB-D from the makefiles provided in the distribution, which will
create targets in the same directory as the input source.  Libraries are
created using libtool which outputs libraries in a directory named '.libs' in
the input's source directory.  Use 'make install' to install GridLAB-D on the
system.  You must be superuser (or use sudo) to install to the system. If you
want to install GridLAB-D to a different location, use:

      % make install prefix=<install-path>.  

where <install-path> is the full path to the installation directory.

Whenever changes have been made to configure.ac or any of the makefile.am
files, the following build steps must be executed from the source-path folder:  
	1. Use 'autoreconf -isf' to update the configure script.
	2. Use './configure' to create the makefiles.
	3. Repeat the above command to make the project as usual.

Make should detect changes to configure.ac and makefile.am files and
automatically rerun steps 1 and 2 as needed.  If files are added to a module,
add the filename to makefile.am in that module's directory and remake. If make
does not automatically perform the required steps, rerun autoreconf -isf and
./configure manually.

To distribute the source code, it is best to check out a clean copy of the
source code and then package the resulting source tree using the
utilities/release-src command from the <source-path> directory.

On Apple OS-X, the GNU libtools are prefixed with a 'g' to differentiate them
from the NeXTStep libtool.  Before performing the steps above, tell the
autotoolset where to find libtool and libtoolize by setting the LIBTOOL and
LIBTOOLIZE environment variables.  The following lines are an example:

    % export LIBTOOL=/usr/bin/glibtool
    % export LIBTOOLIZE=/usr/bin/glibtoolize
    % autoreconf -isf
 
For information on the sample models, see samples/README.

On some platforms you may run into a problem with rpl_malloc being undefined
during the build.  If so, set the following environment before running
./configure

    % export ac_cv_func_malloc_0_nonnull=yes
