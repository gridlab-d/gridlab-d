Changes since MATPOWER 4.0b2
----------------------------

4/19/10
    - Changed licensing to GNU General Public license. See LICENSE and
      COPYING files for details.

3/23/09
    - Fixed bug in smartmkt() that caused it to die for cases with
      non-consecutive bus numbers. Introduced by changes made to
      runmarket() in 4.0b1.


Changes since MATPOWER 4.0b1
----------------------------

2/11/10
    - Fixed bug in design of auction code. Prices are now scaled instead
      of shifted when modified according specified pricing rule
      (e.g. LAO, FRO, LAB, FRB, split-the-difference, etc.). Auctions
      with both real and reactive offers/bids must be type 0 or 5, type
      1 = LAO is no longer allowed.


Changes since MATPOWER 3.2
--------------------------

12/24/09
    - Released version 4.0b1.

12/11/09
    - Updated runmarket, smartmkt, printmkt to pass full OPF results
      struct through to output.

12/8/09
    - Miscellaneous cleanup based on mlint suggestions.

11/4/09
    - Removed unnecessary 'return' statement at end of all M-files. If
      anything it should be an 'end' statement, but even that is
      optional, so we just let functions get terminated by the
      end-of-file or another function declaration.

4/14/09
    - Deprecate use of 'areas' data matrix. Remove it everywhere
      possible without breaking backward compatibility with version 1
      case files, which required it.


Changes since MATPOWER 3.1b2
----------------------------

5/15/07
    - Fixed a display bug where it would show the offer/bid price rather than
      the price of the cleared offer/bid for generators with zero output.


Changes since MATPOWER 3.1b1
----------------------------

9/15/06
    - Released version 3.1b2.


Changes since MATPOWER 3.0.0
----------------------------

8/1/06
    - Released version 3.1b1.

7/10/06
    - Corrected costs of dispatchable gens in t_auction_case.m so that the
	  cost is 0 at 0 output and negative at Pmin.

4/17/06
    - Fixed some bugs in off2case.m and added additional tests related to
      shutting down loads with zero qty bids. It now properly shuts down
      any load with a zero qty P bid, and loads with zero qty Q bids if and
      only if the load has a non-unity power factor.

10/26/05
    - Fixed bug in off2case.m where P-only load was turned off by zero qty Q
      bid. Added corresponding test.
    - Fix in off2case.m for div by zero when Q portion of gencost is not
      specified and we have zero Q bid qty.

10/17/05
    - Rewrite of much of the code to handle reactive power. Added runmarket.m,
      pricelimits.m. Made runmkt a wrapper around new runmarket.

8/11/05
    - Fixed a bug in smartmkt.m which caused incorrect prices to be printed
      in the market summary for single block offers.

4/25/05
    - Fixed a bug in auction.m where prices for rejected bids were computed
      erroneously based on a unity power factor instead of the one defined
      by PMIN and the Q limits.

4/14/05
    - Fixed a bug in auction.m where a withheld offer could end up with
      a tiny bit being accepted, which messed up the prices.

4/6/05
    - Shifted the total cost function generated for bids to intersect the
      origin instead of (Pmin, 0) in off2case.m. This results in objective
      function values that are consistent across different sets of bids.


Changes since MATPOWER 3.0b3
----------------------------

1/24/05
    - Switched to using isload() to check for dispatchable load.
	- Modified off2case.m to keep Q limits consistent with constant power
	  factor for dispatchable loads.

11/18/04
    - Fixed bug in off2case.m for inputs containing zero quantity bids.

9/28/04
    - Modified to auction.m to clip cleared offer prices (but not bid prices)
      to max_p. Other changes to make it more robust for cases with
      very large bid/offer gap.
    
    - In smartmkt.m added conditionals to skip over code related to import
      gens (including offer and max_p adjustments) when there are no import
      generators. Fixed missing return args bug when OPF did not converge.


Changes since MATPOWER 3.0b2
----------------------------

9/15/04
    - Fixed bug in auction.m where locational prices were
      wiped out when generators had only a single block.

    - Fixed small bug in smartmkt.m related to single block
      generators, and worked around another related to handling
      of reserve generators when gencost and genoffer are
      not the same dimension.
      

Changes since MATPOWER 2.5b3
----------------------------

7/2/04
    - Fixed smartmarket.m to print correct prices even for decommitted
      gens

    - Fixed auction.m so that gens at Pmin are not able to set the price
      and each gen still gets a uniform price even if price is clipped by
      the offer/bid of a single block. Added lots of tests.

5/30/03
    - Added auction.m, removed everything to do with continuous
      offer/bid markets.

2/14/01
    - Corrected a comment.

4/3/00
    - Modified smartmkt.m so that reserve generators come in, not
      at the reservation price, but at $5 above the highest
      offer price (excluding offers above reservation price).

3/14/00
    - Made changes to off2case.m to fix problems with negative
      generation.
