Description: power distribution system simulator and analysis tool
 GridLAB-D™ is a new power distribution system simulation and analysis tool
 that provides valuable information to users who design and operate
 distribution systems, and to utilities that wish to take advantage of the
 latest energy technologies. It incorporates the most advanced modeling
 techniques, with high-performance algorithms to deliver the best in end-use
 modeling. GridLAB-D™ is coupled with distribution automation models and
 software integration tools for users of many power system analysis tools.
 .
 GridLAB-D™ was developed by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) at Pacific
 Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), in collaboration with industry and
 academia.
