GridLAB-Dâ„¢ is an open source project to develop the next generation power system simulation technology. It was initiated
in 2004 by the US Department of Energy's Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability at the Pacific Northwest
National Laboratory, and has been continued since in collaboration with industry and academia.

GridLAB-D incorporates advanced load modeling techniques, with high-performance solution algorithms to deliver end-use
load modeling, coupled with power system models, market models, distribution automation models, and software integration
tools for users of many power system analysis tools.
