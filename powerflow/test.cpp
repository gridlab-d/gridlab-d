 * @file test.cpp 
 * This file contains the module_test function, which is called from the
 * gridlab core when the --test <modulename> command line option is used.
 * Nothing in this file should be modified.  Any test classes containing
 * module tests should be placed in the test.h file.  To use this file,
 * a few steps need to be taken to allow for compilation in Visual Studio.
 * 	-# This file, and test.h should be copied into the directory containing 
 * 	the source files for the module to be tested. 
 * 	-# The project for the module needs to be told where to find the cppunit
 * 	include files.  This is done by modifying the properties using the
 * 	properties dialog, expanding the C/C++ subtree, selecting the Additional
 * 	Include Directories property and adding the location of the cppunit include
 * 	directory (usually ..\test\cppunit2\include).
 * 	-# The project needs to be told where to find the shared libraries for
 * 	cppunit.  This will require 2 modifications to the project properties.
 * 		-# Expand the linker subtree, and under Additional Dependancies, add
 * 		cppunitd.lib (for debug configuration) or cppunit.lib (for release
 * 		configuration).
 * 		-# Select the general child of the linker subtree, and add the location
 * 		to the cppunit library files to the Additional Library Directories item
 * 		(usually ..\test\cppunit2\lib)
 * At this point, it should be possible to compile your project with the test
 * files included.
